# How we ensure trust

*Public-facing explainer — no internal implementation details.*

We build a system where trust is based not on claims, but on **verifiable evidence**.

- Every verification produces an **immutable audit pack**.
- Results are recorded in an **evidence ledger**.
- Daily, the ledger is aggregated and **cryptographically anchored**.
- Any party can **verify data integrity** on their own.
- Exceptions are **transparent**, **time-limited**, and **tracked**.

**We do not ask you to trust the process — we provide artifacts that can be verified.**
