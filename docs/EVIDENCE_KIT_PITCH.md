# What is Evidence Kit and Why It Matters

**Evidence Kit** is a reproducible, tamper-evident package that proves your compliance infrastructure works. It answers one question: *"Can I trust what you're showing me?"*

---

**What it is.** A single bundle containing: (1) a demo compliance package — audit pack, decision record, verify-summary, ledger-entry — that anyone can re-run and verify; (2) a regulatory bundle — documentation, AuthZ evidence, UI routing evidence, MANIFEST with checksums; (3) short reports (RU/EN) and a README that tells you where to start.

**Why it matters.** Regulators, partners, and investors need more than slides. They need artifacts they can check. Evidence Kit gives them: SHA-256 checksums for every file, a 3-command verification snippet they can copy-paste, and a clear split between *authoritative* evidence (manifests, verification reports) and *supporting* evidence (screenshots, summaries). No black box. No "trust us."

**The balance.** Formal enough for audit. Simple enough to use. No overkill.
