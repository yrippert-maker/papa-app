# Governance Kit — Reusable Model

**Document ID:** GOV-KIT-001  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-02

## Overview

This document describes the **reusable governance model** used by Papa App. Other teams and organizations can adopt the same approach to achieve audit-grade evidence delivery.

**Goal:** Governance becomes an asset, not a cost center.

---

## Components

### 1. Auditor Pack Generator

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/create-auditor-pack.mjs` | Bundles trust anchors, attestations, snapshots, policies, verifier |
| Input | `WORKSPACE_ROOT`, `schemas/policies/` |
| Output | `auditor-pack-*.tar.gz` with MANIFEST, verify.mjs, VERIFY.md |

**Reusable:** Copy script; adapt paths for your workspace layout.

### 2. Standalone Verifier

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `verify.mjs` (inside pack) | No dependencies; Node.js built-ins only |
| Modes | Permissive, strict, verbose, JSON |
| Checks | Checksums, trust anchors, snapshot chain, policies, attestations |

**Reusable:** Verifier is self-contained; auditors need only Node.js 18+.

### 3. Policy Repository Template

| Structure | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `schemas/policies/POLICY_INDEX.json` | Index of policies with status, version |
| `schemas/policies/*.json` | Individual policy definitions |
| Versioning | Semantic versioning, changelog |

**Reusable:** Copy `schemas/policies/` structure; define your policies.

### 4. Provenance

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `source_git.tag` | package.json version |
| `source_git.commit` | `git rev-parse HEAD` |
| `source_git.origin` | `git remote get-url origin` |

**Reusable:** Same pattern; ensures traceability.

## Adoption Guide

### Step 1: Policy Structure

```
schemas/policies/
  POLICY_INDEX.json
  your-policy-v1.0.0.json
  CHANGELOG.json
```

### Step 2: Auditor Pack Script

- Copy `scripts/create-auditor-pack.mjs`
- Set `WORKSPACE_ROOT` to your evidence location
- Adapt trust anchors / attestations / snapshots paths

### Step 3: Verification

- Pack includes `verify.mjs` (generated by script)
- Auditors: `tar -xzf pack && node verify.mjs`

### Step 4: Release Cadence

- Publish pack with each release
- SHA-256 in release notes
- Optional: CI scheduled workflow for quarterly packs
